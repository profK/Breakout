This is a basic implementation of a Breakout game using SFML anbd Box2D.
Its is a demo and intended as sampel code rather then a polished and shippable game.  Places for improvement include:
- Forcing bounce angles to a minimum to avoid the ball moving parallel to things of interest.
- Counting and displaying a number of balls left
- Multiple levels with different block colors and values

I wrote this as an example for my C++ students.  Its is free and open under MIT license.
It is based on SFML and Box2D which may have their own license requirements.
